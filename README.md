# NextJS + TypeScript + Web3 Starter

This repository has both the frontend, and the contracts.

- [Frontend](./frontend/) is using NextJS + TypeScript. It uses MantineUI, but also supports SASS for further styling.
- [Contracts](./contracts/) is using HardHat + TypeScript. Furthermore, TypeChain is used to generate interfaces for the contracts.
