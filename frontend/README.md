My Web3 frontend starter kit.

## Usage

Just `npm install` and then follow [NextJS instructions](./CNA.md).

- `npm run dev` to start development on your `localhost`.
- `npm run build` to create a production build.

Write your contract addresses for each supported chainID at the [contractAddresses](./constants/contractAddresses.ts) file.
